Files Written by Me:
--------------------
FrontEnd.java : this file contains the entry point of our application and contains all implementation of the front end as described in the project description on canvas.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I organized the initial file structure that we have on a github repo. I also took the initiative and spoke most of the time during our first two meetings. Also, I don't know if the integration manager is supposed to do this, but I reminded everyone of the deadline and made sure that we communicated about our file sharing.

Implementation wise, I reminded the Backend developer that the Backend constructor is supposed to take in a String[] argument as a parameter rather than a File.
