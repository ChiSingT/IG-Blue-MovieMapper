FrontEnd.java : this file contains the entry point of our application and contains all
implementation of the front end as described in the project description on canvas.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I organized the initial file structure that we have on our github repo. I also took the initiative
and spoke most of the time during our first two meetings. I reminded everyone of the deadline and
made sure that we communicated about our file sharing, though people still did not follow the
deadlines established in the first meeting. I also helped every member of my team to understand
each of their responsibilities and the way our code should function as an application. I also
offered with helping out with implementation since we were way behind schedule, but my members were
not very open to setting up a time together and working through the implementation to get the
project done. I received little help from the integration manager on managing our time, even though
I believe this should originally be his job. I reminded the integration manager that it is his
responsibility to upload his implementation of the MapADT interface (HashTableMap) as well as to
complete the Makefile. I also reminded everyone about their individual README files. I also helped
uploading our data wrangler's code as he was having difficulties with using github.

On implementation details, I reminded the Backend developer that the Backend constructor is supposed
to take in a String[] argument as a parameter rather than a File. I also provided feedback as I did
more testing after the Backend developer reported that basic implementation was completed.
