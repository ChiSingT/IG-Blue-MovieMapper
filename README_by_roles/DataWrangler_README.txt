Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Movie.java and MovieDataReader.java were both written by me as well as TestMovieAndMovieDataReader.java contained 2 test methods which were written by me.
Movie.java class extended the MovieInterface and contained setter and getter methods, allowing the properties to be set to their corresponding property as well as allowed the retrieval of these properties.
MovieDataReader.java class extended the MovieDataReaderInterface and contained a readDataSet method which functioned to read an inputed file, throwing exceptions if they occurred.
TestMovieAndMovieDataReader.java class contains a set of tests for the MovieInterface and MovieDataReaderInterface implementations of the Movie Mapper project.
